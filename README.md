## Model Evaluation using TOPSIS ##

This project evaluates different NLP models using TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution). The models are assessed based on fluency, coherence, and perplexity scores, and the results are visualized using graphs. <br>

Features <br>

--> Evaluates multiple NLP models including BERT, GPT-2, BlenderBot, T5, BART, and GPT-Neo. <br>

--> Uses BLEU and ROUGE scores for fluency and coherence evaluation. <br>

--> Applies the TOPSIS method to rank models based on multiple criteria. <br>

--> Visualizes model performance using bar plots. <br>

### Installation ###

--> To run this project, install the required dependencies: <br>

pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn transformers nltk rouge-score matplotlib seaborn <br>



## OUTPUT ##

After running the script, the results include: <br>

--> Ranked list of models with their closeness coefficients. <br>

--> Bar charts visualizing model ranking and performance. <br>



## VISUALIZATION ##

The following plots are generated :
